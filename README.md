- **Inner Circle**: Designed for your closest 150 friends.
- **Emotional Expressiveness**: Custom Avenue Emojis for nuanced reactions.
- **Smart Journaling**: Share thoughts, music, photos, places, and sleep patterns.
- **No-Build Architecture**: Uses ES modules and `esm.sh` for instant loading without complex build steps.
